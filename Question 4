4) Restructure the schema (if necessary) to optimize the above queries (make the queries simpler, run faster, etc)
Here much of restructuring is not necessarily required. But given that the prime intent of this schema would be calculating the scores of each student and attempt,
a new table called 'Scores' may be created using the code: 

CREATE TABLE scores as (	
	SELECT 
		userID, 
		attempt, 
		SUM(CASE WHEN iscorrect THEN 1 END) as score --scores for each attempt
	FROM User_answers
	GROUP BY userID, attempt
);

This table will help in accessing the score without further calculations while querying.
